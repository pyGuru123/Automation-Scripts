## Usage

Click the main.py file to run the bot. It will automatically open chrome and start playing Google Dino. You may be left with two issues

1> Your chrome path may not be same as mine. In this case - just open chrome.exe file location and paste in line #9 ( don't forget %s, see line #9).\
2> Your system screen size may not be same as mine. In this case try adjusting slice values. Slicing is done in the format [y1:y2, x1:x2]
